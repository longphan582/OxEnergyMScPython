    "- Shapefile (.shp): The most widely used format, compatible with most GIS software\n",

    "Always include the CRS information in your exports (this is done automatically if it has been set for the GeoDataFrame)\n",
    "Use descriptive filenames and include any relevant metadata\n",
    "Avoid long column names - shapefiles limit column names to 10 characters. It is often common to include a readme alongside a shapefile that describes the columns and units etc.\n",
