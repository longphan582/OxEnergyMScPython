    "pandapower is an openâ€‘source Python library for power system modelling and analysis. It stores information about a network and provides the functionality for running power-flow calculations, plotting, geospatial interpretability and saving that data. As the name suggests it is built on pandas with the network and power-flow results being stored within pandas dataframes.\n",
